# will-blog
## This blog is a self-educational project made following the "COMPREHENSIVE ASP.NET MVC" video series found [here](http://www.3dbuzz.com/training/view/comprehensive-aspnet-mvc).

The blog is built using ASP.NET MVC with MySql database, Fluent NHibernate ORM, JQuery, and bootstrap.

This project varies from the tutorial in that I'm using the latest versions of software involved such as the .NET framework and some other minor refactoring differences.

The blog post content edtior uses ckeditor, which I did not include this dependency in the repository, so it needs to be [downloaded](http://ckeditor.com/download). Download the standard package and extract everything into a folder named ckeditor in the will-blog/scripts folder. The samples folder in the package is not needed.
