# will-blog
##A simple blog

The blog post content edtior currently uses ckeditor. I did not include this dependency in the repository, so it needs to be downloaded. http://ckeditor.com/download

Download the standard package and extract everything into a folder named ckeditor in the will-blog/scripts folder. The samples folder in the package is not needed.

I will likely change this to a markdown editor later when I get a chance.
